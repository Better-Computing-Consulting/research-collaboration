    Introduction</b></big></big></tt></h3>
        <tt>Model 2.5 is a system whereby SAS programmers can submit to the 
 CDC   SAS jobs to be run on data located in remote sites. To this end the 
 CDC has  made available an FTP server for programmers to upload their SAS 
 jobs. The  SAS jobs are usually accompanied by a RUN file that contains the
 order in  which the SAS jobs are to be executed. Each site that houses data
 implements   a system to periodically check the CDC FTP server for new job
 submissions   waiting to be processed, download the SAS jobs, and process
 them. Each site   also implements a series of cross-site compatible SAS
macros  to aid the programmers  in the process of creating new libraries, 
sending  email notifications, and  uploading files back to the CDC FTP server, 
among  other tasks.<br>
        <br>
        This paper describes how SCK implemented its system for checking
the   CDC  FTP server and processing job submissions. SCK has a Windows 2000
based   system  with a script scheduled to check the CDC FTP server at one
hour intervals.   If the script finds that there are new files in the FTP
server, it will download  them and launch a different script to process the
files. The script that processes the downloads, reads the RUN files and executes 
the SAS jobs in the proper order. SCK has also in place the SAS macros that 
programmers can use in their jobs. These cross-site SAS macros are based 90%
on the original  macros the CDC provided to SCK, and the %10 difference is
transparent to the programmers. &nbsp;The changes were made in order to accommodate
 the differences between Windows and UNIX environments, as UNIX was the original
  environment used to develop the macros.<br>
        <br>
        Accompanying this document are all the scripts, SAS files, and file
 system   structures used to implement Model 2.5 at SCK. For each script
there  are  two versions: one in VBScript and other in Perl Script.<br>

        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SCK implementation of Model 2.5 consists of
 the   following:<br>

          <li><tt>A script called <b>GetFiles.wsf</b> (<a

logs into the CDC FTP server and gets a listing of its files. If the script 
finds new SAS jobs, it will:&nbsp;</tt></li>
                               
  <ol type="a">
            <li><tt>download the new SAS or RUN files into a new, time-coded
 folder,</tt></li>
            <li><tt>launch a different script that will process the downloads,</tt></li>
            <li><tt>send an email to the system administrator with information

</ol>
               
<blockquote><tt>The script will not download files with suffixes other than
    .sas or .run. If the script does not find new files in the FTP server,
 it  will send an email to the system administrator reporting that there
were no new files to download. The script launches    a different script
to process the SAS jobs to be able to exit and be ready    for the next check
of the FTP server.<br>
          </tt></blockquote>
               
<ol start="2">
          <li><tt>A script called <b>ProcessJobs.wsf</b> (<a

all the downloaded   SAS jobs. When the GetFiles script launches the ProcessJobs 
script, it passes   to the ProcessJobs script, as an argument, the name of 
the time-stamped folder  where the SAS jobs where downloaded. The ProcessJobs 
script will:</tt></li>

          <li><tt>SCK also implements the cross-site SAS macros. The definitions 
   for these macros are contained in the file called <a
 href="rsub/smacro1.sas.txt" target="_blank">smacro1.sas</a>. Every programmer 
can use the   macros to work with the data residing in remote sites. For the
most part&nbsp;</tt><tt>SCK</tt><tt>'s   macro definition file is the same
the CDC provided. The file was originally   developed on UNIX environment, 
so some modifications where necessary to make  it compatible with our Windows 
environment. In modifying the macros the highest  priority was to maintain 
the way the macros where called,  so that programmers would not have to use 
the macros differently at SCK. Further, all the path variables contained in
the original macro file were maintained; only their UNIX syntax was changed. 
In  our implementation the equivalent to the UNIX root directory is the C:\ 
drive.  Other than mere path syntax changes, we changed only three macros:<br>
            </tt></li>
               
</ol>
        <tt><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ML Macro</b><br>
        </tt>        
<blockquote><tt>The macro that changed the most was the ML macro. This macro 
   is used to send email notifications from within SAS jobs. In our environment 
   we noticed that every time the ML macro was called a window popped-up. 
The   window alerted the user that a third party program was accessing the 
mail   system. As the window required user intervention, the SAS jobs that 
used  the ML macro could not exit automatically. To get around this problem, 
instead   of using SAS email facility, the ML macro uses a script called 
 <b>sendmail.wsf</b>   (<a
 href="export/home1/eml/rst/vbs.sendmail.wsf.txt" target="_blank">vbs</a> 
or <a href="export/home1/eml/rst/perl.sendmail.wsf.txt" target="_blank">perl</a>). 
When the ML    macro is called, it will use the MAKEFILE macro to write the 
contents of   the subject variable into a file called subject.txt. Then, the
macro will   launch the sendmail script and pass to it the email acronym as
an argument.    Next, the sendmail script will read the contents of subject.txt, 
map the   acronym to the appropriate email address and send the email. The 
way the  programmer calls the macro did not change; only the way the macro 
carries   out the task of sending the email.<br>
          </tt></blockquote>
        <tt><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PUTFILE Macro</b><br>
        </tt>        
<blockquote><tt>This macro allows programmers to upload files onto the CDC
    FTP server from within their SAS jobs. The only change made to this macro 
   was to add "options noxwait" before the system call. This way the command 
   window exits automatically after executing the system call. We supplied 
 the  system script the macro uses to upload the files onto the FTP server. 
 The  script is called <b>snd.wsf</b> (<a
 href="export/home1/eml/rst/vbs.snd.wsf.txt" target="_blank">vbs</a> or <a
 href="export/home1/eml/rst/perl.snd.wsf.txt" target="_blank">perl</a>). The
script takes    the filename and path as its only argument, and after successfully
uploading    the file, it moves the file to a time-stamped folder.<br>
          </tt></blockquote>
        <tt><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAKEFILE Macro</b><br>
        </tt>        
<blockquote><tt>This macro allows the programmers to create files within
their SAS jobs. When we first tested this macro, the files were being placed
at the root of the C:\ drive. We changed value of the variable at line 5
of the macro to c:\sastemp. This way the files are created in the c:\sastemp 
   directory.<br>

        <tt>To setup a server for Model 2.5 a system administrator should 
follow    these steps: a) Change the appropriate variables in the scripts. 
b) Configure    the server so that it can run the scripts. c) Setup the file 
system so that   the scripts and SAS macros can run. d) Run the SAS file containing
the macro   definitions. And e) Schedule the GetFiles script to run at regular
 intervals.<br>
        <br>
        <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Change the appropriate variables in the
scripts.</b><br>
       </tt>       
<blockquote><tt> For the scripts to work the variables indicating the username 
   and password for the CDC FTP server have to be modified to reflect the 
site's   own credentials. Other variables such as smpt server name, email 
sender,  and email recipient (for the script's email report portions) have
 to be adjusted too. Each script has comments indicating what variables (with
  line numbers) have to be changed. &nbsp;(Note: The included scripts have
to be renamed before they can work. &nbsp;The suffix ".txt" and the prefix
"vbs." or "perl." have to be removed.)</tt></blockquote>
       <tt><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Configuring the server to run the scripts.</b><br>
       </tt>       
<blockquote><tt> Depending on what scripting language the system administrator 
   wishes to use and what operating system the server is running, different 
  components might need to be installed.</tt></blockquote>
       <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>VBScript Requirements</b><br>
       </tt>       
<blockquote>                     
  <blockquote><tt>If VBScripts will be used, the server needs to run Windows 
   2000, as the VBScripts contain features not compatible with Windows NT. 
 Also,  the latest Windows Scripting Engine should be installed on the server. 
 The  latest version of the script engine right now is Windows Script Host 
 5.6.  The installation file can be downloaded from this page:</tt></blockquote>

<blockquote>                     
  <blockquote><tt> Furthermore, the VBScripts that access the FTP server rely
on a custom dll to be able to create FTP objects. The dll is called cvrftp.dll,
and it is located in the included folder called uclacvr_ftpdll. In order
for it to work, the dll file has to be registered in the operating system.
To register the dll the system administrator can simply run the batch file
called registerdll.bat, included in the same folder. Another way to register
   the dll is to start a command session, CD into the uclacvr_ftpdll directory
   and run "regsvr32 cvrftp.dll".</tt></blockquote>
       </blockquote>
       <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perl Script Requirements</b><br>
       </tt>       
<blockquote>                     
  <blockquote><tt> If perl scripts will be used, ActivePerl has to be installed 
   in the system. (The perl scripts run in both Windows 2000 and NT servers.) 
   ActivePerl can be downloaded form this page:</tt><tt><br>

     </tt>          <tt> Preferably the MSI package should be downloaded
and installed,   but some Windows installations cannot use the MSI package
because they have   out-dated  versions of the Microsoft Windows Installer.

installed. The latest version  can be downloaded from this page:<br>
